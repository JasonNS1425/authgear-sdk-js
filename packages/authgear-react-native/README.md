# Authgear SDK for React Native

The Authgear SDK for React Native makes it ease to integrate authentication features into your React Native application. In most cases, it involves just a few lines of code to enable multiple authentication methods, such as social logins, passwordless, biometrics logins, one-time-password (OTP) with SMS/WhatsApp, and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
